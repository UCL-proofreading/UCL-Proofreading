Worried about university policy? Rest assured, our proofreading service only corrects grammar, word order, spelling, paragraphing and punctuation. It will not rewrite the work, alter the writing style, or change the content. This means, the manner in which the ideas are expressed in the work will remain the same after the proofreading.
